## Star-fall
**Star-fall** is a fast-paced star shooter written in JavaScript and inspired by the 80's arcade game Galaga*. The aim is to score as many points as possible by destroy an ever-increasing wave of stars before they hit the city.

## Technologies
Star-fall is built using ES6 syntax JavaScript and the p5.js libraries. p5.js is used for HTML5 canvas rendering and p5.play deals with the sprite class and handles collision detection.
